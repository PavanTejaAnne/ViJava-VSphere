# ViJava-VSphere

Created a Java-based command line application based on vijava with three command line arguments.

Note: hname and vname are the names for ESXi host and virtual machine, respectively, displayed in Web client. 
For power on and power off tasks, the program waits until the task completes, then prints out task status and task completion time.  
If the task errors out, print out the reason and task completion time.
